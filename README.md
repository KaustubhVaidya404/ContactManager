# Contact Management Express.js Backend

Welcome to our Express.js backend project, a robust and secure solution for storing and managing personal contact information. This project incorporates user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for data security, while utilizing MongoDB as the database to offer a user-friendly RESTful API for efficient contact management.

## Project Overview

Our Express.js backend project combines modern web development techniques with user authentication to provide a powerful platform for storing and managing personal contact details. Users can securely store and retrieve their contact information, making it a valuable tool for individuals and organizations alike.

## Key Features

### 1. User Authentication with JWT

- **Security First:** We prioritize data security by implementing user authentication using JWT. Users can access their data securely while protecting their personal information.
